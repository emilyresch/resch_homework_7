I plan to make it way cooler in the future! I want to create a scrolling animation so that users can scroll down to the next page (and this will display the content of the next item on the main list)

ALL PAGES - 
Favicon, google font Space Mono, links to Home, my Github and my linkeIn accounts

HOMEPAGE - index.html
Menu items on this page are linked to their respective pages. 

PROJECTS - projects.html
Displays a few projects in cards, with links to the projects

ABOUT ME - aboutme.html
Shows my bio in the left column, and a quote and photo carousel on the right column

CONTACT - contact.html
Input form for name, email, and message, with a submit button
